# Technical Documentation Page

This dummy Netflix landing page was created as a response to Free Code Camp's Build a Technical Documentation Page Challenge and was made as part of the requirements for FCC's Responsive Web Design Certificate.

I wanted to create a nice clean page that was easy to navigate.

The webpage is responsive and built with HTML and CSS3 only as Free Code Camp suggested.
